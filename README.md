🎯 AI Professional Attire Recognition System

A Python-based AI system that detects whether students are following the dress code using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. This project analyzes live camera input, photos, and videos to check if a student is:

✅ Wearing an ID card
✅ Tucking in their shirt
✅ Wearing shoes

🚦 How It Works

If the student meets all three dress code requirements, they are highlighted with a green bounding box.

If any requirement is missing, they are marked with a red bounding box.
